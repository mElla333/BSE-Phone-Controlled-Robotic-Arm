# Phone Controlled Robotic Arm
Hi, I'm Ella! This project that I chose is a robotic arm that uses an Adeept robotic arm drive board, servo motors, and can be controlled by your phone using an Android app. It can peform tasks like moving around at its joints and picking items up with its claw.

# My Project
Below is an image of my phone controlled robotic arm. In the photo, you can see the robotic arm that uses servo motors as well as the Adeept driver board that it is connected to. You can also see the phone with the Android application.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# Second Milestone
For my second milestone, the first step was building the robotic arm. After building my robotic arm with the Adeept Robotic Arm Kit for Arduino, I attempted to try to control my robotic arm with potentiometers. However, an issue I ran into was that some of the motors weren't working. But, after testing the motors and trying different possible solutions, I was able to control my robotic arm with the potentiometers. Now that I knew all my motors were working, my final step for this milestone was controlling my robotic arm using a graphical user interface(GUI). I uploaded the code and connected the GUI from my computer to my robotic arm, however I still couldn't control my robotic arm. Nonetheless, I kept on debugging to find out what could have been the problem, and I ended up getting a working GUI controlled robotic arm.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was controlling a servo motor using an Android application in a mobile device, an Arduino, and a HC-05 Bluetooth Module. My first step was just getting to know how to use servo motors. Next, I learned how to control an LED light using the HC-05 Bluetooth Module and the Android application. After having a good understanding of how to use the Bluetooth Module and the Android application, I started working on controlling a servo motor with these new components. I connected my Arduino with my servo motor and my HC-05 Bluetooth Module, and then I paired my phone with my Bluetooth Module. After everything was connected and some troubleshooting later, I was able to successfully control a servo motor with my phone.
