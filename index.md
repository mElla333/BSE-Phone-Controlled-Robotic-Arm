# Phone Controlled Robot Arm
This project is a robot arm that uses an Arduino, servo motors, and can be controlled by your phone using an Android app. It can peform tasks like moving the claws around and picking items up.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was controlling a servo motor using an Android application in a mobile device, an Arduino, and a HC-05 Bluetooth Module. My first step was just getting to know how to use servo motors. Next, I learned how to control an LED light using the HC-05 Bluetooth Module and the Android application. After having a good understanding of how to use the Bluetooth Module and the Android application, I started working on controlling a servo motor with these new components. I connected my Arduino with my servo motor and my HC-05 Bluetooth Module, and then I paired my phone with my Bluetooth Module. After everything was connected and some troubleshooting later, I was able to successfully control a servo motor with my phone.
